best results achieved:
- g_10   :  1497.66
- g_20   :  1755.51
- g_50   :  2668.19 (inver-over performs slightly better, and increased pop_size)
- g_100  :  4043.70 (with inver-over) (4087.05 with 2 opt)
- g_200  :  5917.32 (much better with high rate, more mutation, generational model)
- g_500  :  10173.91 (again better with high rate) (Final best fitness: 9623.35 with opt 2 after stagnation)
- g_1000 :  20819.52 (takes some time to load the problem, and then 2 minutes to run)

- r1_10   : 184.27
- r1_20   : 337.29 (using mutation_swap and order_crossover with more mutation, increased elitism)
- r1_50   : 661.50 (with hybrid_v3)
- r1_100  : 1143.91
- r1_200  : 2265.78
